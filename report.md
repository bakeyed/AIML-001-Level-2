## Task 1: Linear and Logistic Regression

**Linear Regression** is a supervised learning algorithm that predicts a continuous value by fitting a line to the data. I built a model to predict the likelihood of diabetes using the diabetes dataset from `sklearn`, as the Boston and California datasets had issues.
**Logistic Regression** is a supervised learning algorithm that predicts a binary outcome by modeling probability with a logistic function. Using `sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression`, I classified Iris flowers into two groups based on sepal length and width.
Overall, this task helped me dive into supervised learning models, making predictions and classifications.

## Task 2: Matplotlib and Data Visualization

**Matplotlib** is a Python library for creating visualizations, especially useful in data analysis for plotting data trends, distributions, and comparisons. I explored several plot types—like bar, stacked, histogram, violin, pie, line, and area plots—and learned how to use labels, legends, and subplots. This helped me understand each plot’s purpose in presenting different data insights.
This image includes some of the plots I made.

## Task 3: Numpy

**NumPy** is a powerful library for numerical computations in Python, widely used for handling arrays and mathematical operations efficiently. I used NumPy to generate an array by repeating a smaller array across dimensions, and I created an array with element indexes arranged in ascending order. This practice helped me get familiar with array manipulation and indexing in NumPy.

## Task 4: Metrics and Performance Evaluation

Metrics and Performance Evaluation are essential in machine learning to assess how well models perform.

**Regression metrics** like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared assess how well models predict continuous values.
**Classification metrics** such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and AUC-ROC evaluate the effectiveness of models in predicting discrete classes.

This task helped me evaluate my model and consider different optimization techniques to help solve issues.

## Task 5: Linear and Logistic Regression from Scratch

In this task, I implemented Linear and Logistic Regression models from scratch, deepening my understanding of their functionality.

**Linear Regression** employs the familiar formula `y=mx+b` , where y represents the predicted value, xxx is the input parameter, m is the slope, and b is the y-intercept.

**Logistic Regression** predicts a binary outcome using the sigmoid function, which helps separate classes. While commonly used for binary classification, it can also be adapted for multiclass problems. This implementation enhanced my grasp of both models and their applications in data analysis.

## Task 6: K-Nearest Neighbor Algorithm

KNN classifies data by identifying the 'k' closest examples and using majority voting to determine the predicted class. This approach effectively distinguishes between different iris species based on sepal and petal measurements.
